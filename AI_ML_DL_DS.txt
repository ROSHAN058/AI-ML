Artificial Intelligence Vs Machine Learning Vs Deep Learning Vs Data Scientists
AI application:- Recommendation engine, self-driving machine (task performed without human intervention)
Machine Learning:- Stats tool to analyze, visualize, predict, and forecast the data.
Deep Learning: A multi-layer Neural network aims to mimic the human brain.

DS is part of all 

Machine learning and Deep Learning:-
1. Supervised Machine Learning --> Regression and classification (we need one dependent variable to predict using multiple independent or one independent variable)
2. Unsupervised machine Learning -->clustering and Demensionatility reduction (we do not have a dependent variable using grouped data to identify the clusters
and dimension reduction meaning reducing the feature variable from e.g 1000 to 10 )
3. Reinforcement learning 

Supervised MachineLearning:-
1. Regression:-if the dependent variable is continuous like weight, height, or price then we call this regression
2. Classification:- if the dependent variable has a fixed class category called classification like if it is 2 called a binary classification or multi-class classification.
